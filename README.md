# risk_utils  ### Python utilities for risk model / scorecard development, implementation and monitoring.  Utility code covers  1.  Data prepration 2.  Extreme value treatment (EVT) 3.  Missing value treatment (MVT) 4.  WOE binning 5.  Correlation 6.  Linear regression, R^2 and VIF 7.  Logistic regression 8.  Model performance measures (Gini, KS, risk rank ordering etc) 9.  Model stability measures (In time, OOT validation, PSI, CSI etc) 10. Model execution optimization, automated documentation and Unit testing 11. Model virtual env and package as docker 12. MLFlow for model register, scheduler and execution 13. Model visualization using Bokeh and Dash 14. Model development and execution in cluster computing (PySpark and Dask)  Examples: 1. Acquisition Risk Scorecard 2. Behaviour Risk Scorecard 3. Collection Risk Scorecard (Balance at Risk) 4. Fraud Model - Application / Transaction Fraud  5. Impairment Model (PD, LGD, EAD and ECL calc) 6. Capital Model (PD, LGD, EAD, RWA calc) 7. Stress Testing
